## What are design principles?

Design principles are concise guidelines to aid the ideation and evaluation of product designs. They focus and inspire creative thinking and align the team when making decisions. 

## Why do you need design principles?

When product goals are stated clearly, the design team can explore many different potential solutions. For example, suppose your goal is to deliver a specific message to a customer. Should the information be conveyed in a conversational or a formal way? Should it be concise but allow users to dig in for greater transparency, or does it need to be thorough which may come off as a little intimidating? Exploring and answering questions like these is one point in the design journey.

Design principles provide constraints which focus how you approach your work, and help your team critique your design explorations using a shared vocabulary. Paired with properly formulated product goals, your design team will have room to creatively explore solutions within an understood problem space.

## Guidelines for writing principles

#### Grounded 

Principles carry more weight when they relate to research, not heuristics like ‘best practices’, or personal preferences. This grounding ensures that your design ideation focuses on the unique aspects of the product. 

#### Concise 

Principles need to be top of mind and easy to keep in working memory. Choose words carefully.

#### Actionable 

Principles should be specific enough to be actionable. A principle like ‘delightful’ or ‘simple’ sounds nice but is too open to interpretation unless qualified or contextualized.

## Format

Each principle includes a short title (a word or short phrase) and 1-2 sentences that clarify the principle. The principles are presented on a single page so they’re easy to reference and see in total.

## Changing principles

Feedback from customers and stakeholders can prompt you to make your principles more specific, cut ones that didn’t pan out, or add new ones that surfaced later. When you uncover learning, formally revisit the principles as an alignment touchstone.

## Guerilla principles

We don’t always have access to all the research we need. Sometimes the client resists giving access to customers. Sometimes the timeframe or budget limits us. 
In these cases, it’s still important to work from principles, even if they’re less grounded. Heuristics such as best practices can still help focus ideation and align the team on evaluating designs. For example, if you’re designing software for a productivity app, common sense suggests a principle like:

**Minimize user input**

Remember and anticipate user decisions in expected ways. Completing a task should feel as efficient and effortless as possible.
